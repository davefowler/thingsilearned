I just finished reading Viktore E. Frank's [Man's search for Meaning](http://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl/dp/080701429X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1229405975&sr=8-1) and highly recommend it.  It is by a psychologist who spent two years in concentration camps during WWII.  There are two parts: the first is an account and observations of the time he spent in the camps.  The second is an introduction to logotherapy, the school of therapy he created from his experiences.

Of course as part of all of this he discusses the meaning of life, why we seek it, and whether the question "What is the meaning to life?" is what we should really be asking.

I wanted to share this paragraph:

_"Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality.  No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him.  By his love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, he sees that which is potential in him, which is not yet actualized but yet ought to be actualized.  Furthermore by his love, the loving person enables the beloved person to actualize these potentialities.  By making him aware of what he can be and of what he should become, he makes these potentialities come true."_

If you haven't read it yet go get it from your library or [amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl/dp/080701429X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1229405975&sr=8-1).  Its a quick and important read.
