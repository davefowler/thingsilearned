Almost two years ago on a cranky afternoon I wrote this uninformed and poorly edited article:  [Xcode Editor Kinda sux](/2007/04/26/xcode-shortcuts/).

Since that day it has consistently been the top daily hit on my blog.  I did some Googlein' and discovered that it is the top link (maybe just in my search context) when searching for ["xcode editor"](http://www.google.com/search?q=xcode+editor&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a).

This probably makes the team who works on the editor unpleased... Sorry gu![](http://www.printactivities.com/ColoringPages/Frankenstein-Coloring-Pages/Angry-Frankenstein-2.gif)ys.  Let me know if you've made short cuts for that yet and I'll write an update.

I looked at my stats and found this:








[Xcode Editor - Kinda Sucks](/2007/04/26/xcode-shortcuts/)


1,330




[Zope3/Plone to Django](/2007/08/14/zope3plone-to-django/)


1,215








[The Dangers of a Startup](/2007/07/09/the-dangers-of-a-startup/)


925


Once you're done laughing at my piddly traffic you may notice that my top 2 blog highly trafficked blog posts of all time were also the most negatively critical.  The 3rd link isn't negative by nature, but does have a negative title.  I will chalk that one up as a fluke as most of its traffic came from a single day that it was on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com).

I'm personally quite proud that in my few years of blogging the crankiest opinion based things I've written about are those top two posts.  But, perhaps I would be more proud of greater traffic had I been less reserved.

My blog is a small sampleset.  Has anyone noticed similar trends?
