![](http://www.wundrbar.com/images/screenshot1.jpg)I have a lot of cool friends and a lot of other friends who try to be cool by owning iPhones. To those people I want to advertise a cool new App that was released in the store today by a few friends of mine:

Its called Wundrbar and basically gives you one click access and super easy usability for tons of web services out there. Using the web on a phone is super handy but super annoying. Wundrbar fixes the annoying parts.

Here's a list of a few things it does easily.



	
  * check airfairs and book tickets

	
  * easy buy on amazon

	
  * find low gas prices

	
  * public transport schedules

	
  * Lists top links of popular websites

	
  * etc. etc.


Read more about it at the link above on on [this review](http://www.whatsoniphone.com/blogs/new-app-store-wundrbar). Its 70 apps in 1 at the low price of $1.99 which is like 3 cents per app so its for sure worth it!

If you want to be cool you'd better get it.
