I've sadly spent the better part of the day getting Satchmo deployed on my slicehost.  It should've been easy, as I've already installed it on my mac.  Due to Satchmo backwards incompatibilities and some odd things with slicehost locale's its now a late night and I have a banged head and more than a few dents in the wall :).  

Wanted to share the following post which I'd wished I found much earlier.


## [Card store project #2: Installing Satchmo, Django, PostgreSQL, and Apache on Ubuntu at Slicehost](http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2008/12/card-store-project-2-installing-satchmo-django-postgresql-and-apache-ubuntu-slicehost/)


Some keywords for the common error with the locale: bad settings.LANGUAGE_CODE satchmo
