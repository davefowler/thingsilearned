It happened a few weeks ago and we mentioned it on the [Socialbrowse Blog](http://socialbrowse.com/blog/2009/mar/27/on-the-news/) but I feel like mentioning it here as well. Socialbrowse was covered on the News!  Zack and I were interviewed by Ali Lucia and were really pleased with the coverage.  Unfortunately I can't embed the video in this wordpress blog so you'll have to follow the link:

So what did I learn from being on the news?  A few things:



	
  1. It doesn't bring much traffic to a web site

	
  2. It brings substantial clout among friends/family who wonder what I'm doing with my life

	
  3. You get some temporary local fame/recognition

	
  4. Its best to be prepared (our site was going down during our interview :)

	
  5. 95% of what you say in an interview isn't used

	
  6. So speaking in small poignant sentences helps
