<img src="{{media_url('images/profile.jpg') }}" />

I am an entrepreneur currently serving as the Founder and CEO of [Chartio](http://chartio.com) where I'm focused on bringing data visualization to a whole new group of people at an ease and price point that have never before been possible.  We're collecting data about everything around us and its time that people were able to harness that better.

I've founded 2 other companies, am an Alumni of the University of Minnesota, Gustavus Adolphus and Y Combinator.  After college, and before the startups I worked at IBM on the XBox360 processor where I lead 10 patents pending.

I was listed in [Forbes' 30 under 30 in Technology for 2011][Forbes2011] and [2012][Forbes2012].
