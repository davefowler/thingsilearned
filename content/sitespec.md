- ThingsILearned is not simply a blog
- Projects should have their own style
- Links to external writings should be obviously changing sites
- The layout should be simple and straightforward
- The design should be minimal - similar to chart design
- The design should attempt to be as timeless as possible and also adjustable
- There's no need to use too many images, or require an image per post
- Old posts should maintain a great format - don't let them get ugly or useless
- Posts that are no longer relevant should be noted as such in some way (ie. Orbited stuff)
- The font should be large, well spaced and readable
