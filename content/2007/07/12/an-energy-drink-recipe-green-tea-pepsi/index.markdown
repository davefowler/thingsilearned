Vu here. For a pumped up energy-drink (without all the added amino acids), I like to prepare a green tea and Pepsi mixture that not only tastes good, but has all the caffeine I'll need (about 40mg) and all the benefits that green tea[ potentially offers.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_effects_of_tea_on_health)

Here's how to make it:
Steep your favorite green tea in a quarter cup boiling water for 2 or 3 minutes . . . enough for a small amount of tea that's fairly concentrated (i.e. bitter). Add a spoonful of maple syrup. (Substitute: sugar.)

Let the tea cool for a few minutes in the fridge. Once suitably cold, grab a can of Pepsi, (substitute Coke if preferred) and pour that into the tea. Makes 14 ounces. (Add more tea to get the proportion of a regular-sized energy drink.)

Now you can have your tea polyphenols AND teeth-hurting sugar too.
