		 </div>
		 <p><img alt="" src="http://cre8tivecontrol.com/cre8tive3/images/stories/wordpress/wordpress-logo.png" />For a long time I've had this site at thingsilearned.wordpress.com and have had the domain thingsilearned.com simply re-directing to the blog.  Today I decided what the heck, I'll skip dinner and instead spend the 10 bucks to have thingsilearned.com be the actual blog domain.</p>
<p>Wordpress makes this fairly straight forward though one step was confusing for me.  It seems that wordpress will not let you buy the 10 credits for using your own domain until it is sure that your domain is using the Wordpress nameservers.  </p>
<p>The first step is to visit the <a href="http://thingsilearned.wordpress.com/wp-admin/paid-upgrades.php?page=domains">Domains</a> link under Upgrades in the left panel of your Wordpress Dashboard.  Enter in the domain you'd like to register.  </p>
<p>If your domain is not using the wordpress nameservers it will ask you to direct your domain to these nameservers:</p>
<p><a href="http://NS1.WORDPRESS.COM/">NS1.WORDPRESS.COM</a>
<a href="http://NS2.WORDPRESS.COM/">NS2.WORDPRESS.COM</a>
<a href="http://NS3.WORDPRESS.COM/">NS3.WORDPRESS.COM</a></p>
<p>It may take a few minutes to process, but when its done you can go through the same steps in the <a href="http://thingsilearned.wordpress.com/wp-admin/paid-upgrades.php?page=domains">Domains</a> page but this time it will take you to a prompt to "Buy Credits".  </p>
<p>After you've purchased the credits you'll be taken back to the Domains page where you choose which of the domains (your new one, or the old wordpress one) to be the main domain of your blog.  Oddly, by default its still using the wordpress domain.  Make the change and you'll be done!</p>
<p>On a side note, I haven't been blogging much lately.  There's a lot going on with Socialbrowse and I'm still learning a ton but its unfortunately mostly confidential for a short while yet.  Most of the things I'm learning are directly linked to what we're soon releasing and I don't want to let the cat out of the bag just yet!</p>		 </article>
