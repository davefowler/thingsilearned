         <p>I recently suspected the dreaded buffer overrun in a project I'm hacking for work.  These can be a huge pain to find, especially if your code has a considerable amount of mallocs and fails irregularly.  After dismissing the urge to just write it all in python (wasn't practical for the application) I decided to learn a malloc debugging tool.</p>
<p>I was excited to learn that macs come with their own malloc debuger, entitled Malloc Debugger.  How handy!  Through several attempts to use it on my application however I kept getting the same error.</p>
<p><em>Unable to read malloc information from (null)</em></p>
<p>I'm probably just missing some libraries to include that would have been had I been using Xcode.  Instead I was compiling with g++ -g.</p>
<p>Anyway, I eventually checked out <a href="http://linux.softpedia.com/get/Programming/Debuggers/Electric-Fence-3305.shtml">Electric Fence</a> (efence) and had decent results.  It didn't compile right away, you have to comment out line 33 of page.c as stated in <a href="http://lists.apple.com/archives/xcode-users/2005/Oct/msg00791.html">this mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>Copy the compiled library libefence.a to /usr/lib/ and re-compile your application with the flag -lefence.</p>
<p>Upon execution it will spit out problems you have in your malloc code and die if there was a buffer overrun.  Its a great tool to turn on while you work as you'll be informed of any overwrites as you're developing.  Not after the whole thing is done and quitting at odd times :).</p>
