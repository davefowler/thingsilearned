               <h1>On making business cards with Photoshop</h1>
         </div>
         <p>Vu here. Since signing onto this project, I've had to figure out a thing or two about the program I'd be using for the artwork, namely, Photoshop. (It's true that I've only produced one or two works so far using the program. I also feel that "winging it" is the sine qua non of a successful startup . . . ^_^) Yesterday I spent the day learning shapes, text effects, and color to produce what you see here:</p>

<p>Perhaps more could be said on best practices for business cards. I would not be the one to ask. Rather, here's what was used to make some of the effects seen above.</p>
<p>The logo: A free font was used, with blending options set to inner shadow, gradient overlay, and stroke. In order to keep the logo consistent with any future color choices, I used transparent blend modes like overlay and multiply.</p>
<p>Shapes: By keeping them as vector-type shapes in their own layer, I could quick edit the position of the vertices without loss of quality.</p>
<p>The figure: Solid black lines over layers of solid colors with no dodge or burn layers, painted at 300% resolution and down-sampled for the business card, which was further down-sampled for web viewing.</p>
<p>Color: A case study in trial and error. The color will probably be tweaked for a while to come. (It was suggested that bright colors would look friendly and personable, like our friend Jared.)</p>
