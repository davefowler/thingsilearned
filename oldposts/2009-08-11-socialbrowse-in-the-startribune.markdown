Yesterday I was on the cover of the Business section of the StarTribune.  Its a nice article that talks a bit about Socialbrowse and my path to what I'm doing right now.

It also talks about [Luke Francl](http://luke.francl.org/) and his awesome startup [FanChatter](http://fanchatter.com) which is also from Minnesota and also in YCombinator.  Here is a link to the article

The print version comes with pretty pictures of Luke and I which I think is worth the money :).

Thanks [Thomas Lee](http://www.startribune.com/bios/10645266.html) for the nice coverage.
